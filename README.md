A simple net application that I did to show Maine a way to implement web-based technologies.
In this repository, I learned EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating) and enforced it with my Node Application.
I have passed through the Digital Ocean web site so as to implement this javascript.
Five major steps have to be compelled to follow for running EJS into node application.
Setup the project, piece server.js file, produce EJS files, Add EJS files to look at section, Paas the information to look at section.
Step 1 — Setting Up the Project

Step 3— Creating the EJS Partials
Step 4 — Adding the EJS Partials to Views
Step 5 — Passing Data to Views and Partials
